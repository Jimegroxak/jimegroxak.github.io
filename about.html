            I first became interested in programming in my middle school algebra class when a friend of mine showed me a
            quadratic formula solver that he had made on his graphing calculator. From that point on I was hooked, and
            taught myself how to code on my own calculator, making simple games like Rock, Paper, Scissors and a
            rudimentary text-based RPG to show off to my friends. This interest in programming continued into
            highschool, where I took as many coding and engineering courses
            as I could, learning data structures and algorithms, the creation process, and how to code on an
            actual computer.

            I knew from early on that I wanted to pursue software development as a career, and so I enrolled in
            the Computer Science program at Fordham University in 2019. Fordham gave me many opportunities to hone my
            craft,
            from learning from distinguished experts in their subfields, to gaining practical experience through
            internships and participation in the Computer Science Society. Of particular note was
            the opportunity to work as a robotics research assistant under Dr. Damien Lyons. This work sparked an
            intense interest in AI and robotics, an interest I have worked to maintain post-grad. Our research involved
            using Visual Homing on a fleet of robots, using landmarks that the robots had in common to navigate them in
            a way that is fully autonomous and not reliant on GPS or an internet connection. Our work together
            culminated in two research papers where I am listed as a coauthor. These papers are both linked at the
            bottom of this page.

            After graduating, I began working in my current role as a Technology Consultant at Ernst and Young,
            specializing in SAP. During my time there, I have learned and gained a greater appreciation for how integral
            software solutions are for business, in addition to our every day lives. I have had the opportunity to work
            for a wide range of clients, customizing various SAP offerings to fit their unique requirements. I also
            developed my data science and vizualization skills through the creation and maintenance of project staffing
            plans. While I enjoy the work, I am looking for a role that would allow me to more directly contribute to
            the creation of new technologies, in a more technical role as opposed to my current one, which is more
            business-oriented.

            Outside of all things computer, I enjoy cooking, watching movies and anime, and have recently been trying,
            with various levels of success, to get back into reading and running. I currently live in Brooklyn, and try
            my best to take advantage of all the opportunites living in the greatest city in the world offers.
